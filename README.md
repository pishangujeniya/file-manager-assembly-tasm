# file-manager-assembly-tasm

### Information

* This project was developed as a part of my undergraduate studies for the subject of Advanced Microprocessor Architecture.
My project aims to implement File Manager using Buttons as
Graphical User Interface.
It would be consisting of following functionalities of File
Management.
1. Create a File
2. View a File
3. Copy a File
4. Rename a File
5. Delete a File
6. Create a Directory
7. Remove a Directory
8. Change a Directory
9. List all in a Directory
10. Buttons Action for Above all functions

To perform the above mentioned tasks I have used mainly three
[Bios Interrupts](http://www2.ift.ulaval.ca/~marchand/ift17583/dosints.pdf), INT 10h, INT 33h, INT 21h


* This project was developed in the month of **November 2015**


### Development Guides

* Assmebly file IT_100.asm,
* Use [GUI Turbo Assembler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/guitasm8086/) for executing the program.



## Credits

* Thanks to my professors Prof. Siddhi Joshi and Prof. Rajendra Chhajed.
* Though I have not used any IDE except [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) during development of project but, while creating this repository I found that [GUI Turbo Assembler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/guitasm8086/) by [Lakhya Jyoti Nath](https://www.ljnath.com/) is good for working and execution.
